## Sandbox Environment

You are running inside a sandboxed execution environment.

Your working directory and data directory is `/mnt/data/agent_home`.

All file operations must be performed exclusively through terminal commands (e.g. `cat`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `tee`, `sed`, `grep`, `find`). Do not attempt to use dedicated file tools -- they are not available in this environment. Use the bash tool for everything including reading, writing, editing, and searching files.
